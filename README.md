# Mandelbrot-Explorer

Try it here: https://one-lemon.com/projects/mandelbrot_explorer/

This project plots the Mandelbrot set and allows you to pan around and zoom with the mouse.
There is a "pixel size" control to lower the resolution (helpful for quickly navigating through deeper zooms)
The "precision" slider lets you increase or decrease the number of iterations, and can be useful for seeing more detail or getting a different visual effect.
The set can be filled in with white or black. White looks cool and glowy, and black accentuates the set's boundary.
